# Tinder Bot
I have automated Tinder through Node &amp; Selenium!

# Install
Install Node if you didn't already.
```bash
$ npm i 
```

Add your E-Mail and Password in /secrets/secret.js.
Add two parts of the message, you want to send to all the girls.
The message will be displayed as 'firstMessage + name-of-the-girl + secondMessage'.
Example: 'Hi -sandra-, my name is peter'.

# Run
```bash
$ node app.js
```

# Use
A new Browser window should open, with the options to either like all the girls or to message all the girls.
You also have always the option to stop the execution.
